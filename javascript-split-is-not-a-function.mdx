One error you might encounter when running JavaScript code is:

```ts
TypeError: split is not a function
```

This error occurs when you call the `split()` method from a value thatâ€™s not of string type.

Let me show you an example that causes the `TypeError: split is not a function` error and an easy way to fix it.

How to reproduce this error
Suppose you want to split a string into an array. You called the split() method from a variable as follows:
```ts 
const today = new Date();
```

```ts
const dateArray = today.split(" ");
```

When you run the code above, you get this error:

```ts
TypeError: today.split is not a function
```

This is because the `split()` method is called from a Date object, which is created using the new Date() construct.

The `split()` method is not available in a Date object, so JavaScript responded with split is not a function error.

How to fix this error
To resolve this error, you need to convert the non-string object into a string first using the toString() method.

Hereâ€™s an example fix:

```ts
const today = new Date();
```
```ts
const dateArray = today.toString().split(" ");
console.log(dateArray); // [ Thu', Jul', '20', ...]
```

The same solution works with other JavaScript objects. In another example, suppose you want to create an array from the Document location object:
```ts
const loc = document.location;
```
```ts
const locArr = loc.toString().split("/");
console.log(locArr); // ['https:', '', 'sebhastian.com', ...]
```

The `toString()` method allows you to convert an object into a string representing the objectâ€™s value.

Alternatively, you can also call the `split()` method only from a string by using the typeof operator:
```tsx
const today = new Date();

if (typeof today === "string") {
  const dateArray = today.toString().split(" ");
  console.log(dateArray); // [ Thu', Jul', '20', ...]
} else {
  console.log("Not a string object");
}
```

Or you can also check the type using the ternary operator as follows:
```ts
const today = new Date();
const result = typeof today === 'string' ? today.split('/') : "";
console.log(result);
```
Here, `the split()` method is only called when the typeof the variable is a string. Otherwise, an empty string is returned. You can use the solution that gives the desired result.

I hope this tutorial helps. Happy coding! ðŸ™Œ
